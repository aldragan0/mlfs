# Machine Learning From Scratch (mlfs)

A repository containing ML algorithms implemented from scratch (python + Numpy)

The repo currently has vectorized implementations + examples for the following algorithms:

ML algorithms:

* One variable linear regression
* Multi-variable linear regression
* Multi-variable logistic regression

DL algorithms:

* Neural Network
* Dense Layer

* Optimizers:
	* SGD (stochastic gradient descent)

* Activations:
	* Sigmoid
	* Linear
	* ReLU

* Losses:
	* Mean Squared Error
	* Categorical Crossentropy
	* Categorical Crossentropy from logits
